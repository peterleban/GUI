This directory contains Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Libera Brilliance+ instrument.

GUI panels were developed under CSS Phoebus environment.
The GUI supports the latest software release (3.6) and features introduced
in the new BPM module (KRAF).

Copy or fork the .bob files and open the "main.bob" file.
The .bob files contain a macro definition (DEVICE). It must be defined in the "main.bob"
file and is then linked to other related .bob files automatically.

DEVICE stands for the IOCname (EPICS prefix). The IOCname is defined
in the Libera instrument ( /opt/libera-ioc/IOCname )
