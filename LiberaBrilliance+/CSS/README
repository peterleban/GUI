Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Libera instruments.

This GUI version works with the Control System Studio (CSS)
environment ( http://controlsystemstudio.org/ )
The CSS environment can be installed under Windows, Linux and OSX
operating systems.

Copy or fork the .opi files and open the "main.opi" file.
The .opi files contain a macro definition (DEVICE). It must be
defined in the "main.opi" file and is then linked to other related .opi files automatically.

DEVICE stands for the IOCname (EPICS prefix). The IOCname is defined
in the Libera instrument ( /opt/libera-ioc/IOCname )


RELEASE NOTES:
* This is the first GUI based on the CSS. It does not support all functionalities yet.

Contributions are much appreciated.
